completed_items:
- Runtime V2 round-2 control-plane closure is considered complete and reusable.
- Memory Governance proposal-first / review-commit / explicit override loop is complete enough for product use.
- Chapter Workbench already supports focused / flow / release-ready operator modes.
- release-ready lane now exposes pressure suggestion, stay-or-switch judgment, confidence, and drift across queue rail / Operator Lens / Session Digest.
- Forge batch-1 is verified complete: release-ready lane now also exposes a higher-level lane health summary across queue rail / Operator Lens / Session Digest.
- Forge batch-2 is verified complete: release-ready lane health now drives a stronger top-line routing cue across queue rail / Operator Lens / Session Digest.

next_mainline_focus:
